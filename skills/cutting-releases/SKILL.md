# Cutting Releases

Releases are driven by annotated git tags. When a tag matching `v*` is pushed,
`.github/workflows/release.yml` runs GoReleaser to build binaries, generate a
changelog, and create the GitHub release.

## Process

Before starting step 1, read
[pre-flight.md](pre-flight.md) in this skill's directory and complete
the pre-flight audit. Do not proceed until the user confirms GO.

Follow these steps in order.

### 1. Confirm the branch

Releases should be cut from `main`. Verify you are on `main` and up to date:

```
git checkout main && git pull --tags --force
```

### 2. Determine the version

Check the latest tag:

```
git tag --sort=-v:refname | head -5
```

Decide the next version following semver:

| Change type | Example bump |
|---|---|
| Breaking / major milestone | `v1.0.0` |
| New functionality (MVP, feature set) | `v0.X.0` |
| Bug fixes only | `v0.0.X` |
| Release candidate | `v0.X.0-rc.N` |

### 3. Confirm the version with the user

Use `AskUserQuestion` to present your proposed version tag and the rationale
for your choice. For example:

> I'd suggest `v0.2.0` — there are 5 new `feat:` commits since `v0.1.0` and
> no breaking changes. Does that look right, or would you prefer a different
> version?

Do not proceed until the user confirms.

### 4. Ask for a tag subject

Use `AskUserQuestion` to ask:

> Any special title for this release? (e.g. "MVP Release Candidate 1")
> Leave blank to use just the version tag.

The answer becomes the tag subject line. If blank, use the tag name itself as
the subject so that GoReleaser's `name_template` guard (`ne .TagSubject .Tag`)
suppresses it, producing a clean release title without duplication.

### 5. Gather changes since last tag

```
git log --oneline <previous-tag>..HEAD
```

Summarize changes into categories (features, fixes, refactors). Exclude
`docs:`, `test:`, `chore:`, `ci:`, `build:` commits — GoReleaser filters these anyway.

### 6. Create the annotated tag

Build the tag message:

- **Line 1 (subject):** The custom title from step 4, if one was given.
  If no custom title, **use the tag name itself** (e.g. `v0.9.0`) — git's
  `%(contents:subject)` skips leading blank lines, so a blank first line
  still picks up the first category header as `.TagSubject`. Using the tag
  name as subject ensures `.TagSubject == .Tag`, which the goreleaser guard
  suppresses, producing a clean release title with no suffix.
- **Line 2:** Blank.
- **Lines 3+:** Summary of highlights organized by category.

```
git tag -a v0.X.0 -m "<message>"
```

The first line of the annotation becomes the release title suffix via
GoReleaser's `name_template` (see `.goreleaser.yml`).

### 7. Push the tag

```
git push origin <tag>
```

GoReleaser takes over from here. Verify the workflow starts:

```
gh run list --workflow=release.yml --limit=1
```

### 8. Move the `v0` tag

Downstream orgs reference reusable workflows via `@v0`. Use
`AskUserQuestion` to confirm before force-pushing:

> About to force-push `v0` to `<tag>`. This immediately changes what
> all downstream `@v0` consumers resolve. Proceed?

Once confirmed:

```
git tag -f v0 <tag>
git push origin v0 --force
```

The Sandbox Images workflow (triggered by tag push) will also run.

### 9. Run post-flight verification

Read [post-flight.md](post-flight.md) in this skill's directory and
follow the post-flight verification procedure.

### 10. Install the binary locally

Use `AskUserQuestion` to ask where to install (default: `~/.local/bin/`),
then run the install script using its repo-root-relative path:

```bash
bash skills/cutting-releases/scripts/install-binary.sh <tag> [install-dir]
```

The script downloads the archive, verifies its SHA-256 checksum, and
installs the binary as `fullsend-<tag>` so multiple versions can coexist.

## Notes

- **Pre-releases:** Tags with `-rc.N`, `-alpha.N`, or `-beta.N` suffixes are
  automatically marked as pre-releases by GoReleaser.
- **Never delete a published tag.** If a release is bad, cut a new patch or RC.
- **The changelog** is auto-generated from conventional commit prefixes.
- **The `v0` tag** is a moving tag consumed by downstream orgs for reusable
  workflows. Always move it as part of the release process (step 8).
