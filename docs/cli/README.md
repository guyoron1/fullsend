# Fullsend CLI

The `fullsend` CLI manages the complete fullsend lifecycle: provisioning GCP infrastructure, configuring GitHub, enrolling repositories, and running agents locally.

## Installation

Download the latest binary from [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/fullsend-ai/fullsend/releases). For detailed setup instructions, see [Getting Started](../guides/getting-started/).

## Command groups

| Command group | Description |
|--------------|-------------|
| [`fullsend agent`](agent.md) | Manage agent registrations — add, list, update, remove, and migrate-customizations |
| [`fullsend github`](github.md) | Configure GitHub orgs and repos — setup, enrollment, day-2 operations |
| [`fullsend inference`](inference.md) | Manage GCP Workload Identity Federation for Agent Platform access |
| [`fullsend mint`](mint.md) | Deploy and manage the OIDC token mint service |
| [`fullsend repos`](repos.md) | Manage per-repo installations at scale via declarative manifest |

## Additional commands

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `fullsend run` | Execute an agent locally in a sandbox. See [running agents locally](../guides/user/running-agents-locally.md). |
| `fullsend lock [agent-name]` | Pin remote dependencies to `lock.yaml` |
| `fullsend scan` | Run security scanners on agent input/output |
| `fullsend file-issue` | Create a GitHub issue with dedup guard (duplicate detection) |

## Global flags

All commands that interact with GitHub resolve authentication via `gh` CLI or `GH_TOKEN` environment variable. For GitLab, set `GITLAB_TOKEN` or pass `--gitlab-token` to `repos` subcommands. The CLI runs preflight checks and tells you exactly which OAuth scopes are missing before making any changes.

For the complete command tree with implementation details, see [CLI internals](../guides/dev/cli-internals.md).
