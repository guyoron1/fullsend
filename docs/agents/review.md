# Review Agent

<img src="icons/review.png" alt="Review agent icon" width="80">

Code review specialist that evaluates pull requests for correctness, security, intent alignment, style, and documentation currency.

## How the agent works

The review agent is triggered when a PR is opened or updated. It follows the same pre-script / sandbox / post-script pipeline as the other agents.

1. **Pre-script** validates inputs and fetches PR metadata.
2. **Sandbox** — the agent runs the `pr-review` orchestrator skill. The orchestrator triages the change, then dispatches specialized sub-agents in parallel — each covering a distinct review dimension (correctness, security, intent & coherence, style & conventions, docs currency, and optionally cross-repo contracts). Sub-agents run concurrently and return structured findings. The orchestrator collects, deduplicates, and synthesizes findings across dimensions, runs PR-level checks (scope authorization, protected paths), and produces a structured JSON review result. The agent cannot push files, edit code, or push — it is strictly read-only.
3. **Validation loop** — the output is checked against a schema, with up to 2 retry iterations if the output is malformed.
4. **Post-script** posts the review on the PR.

If a prior review exists (e.g., re-review after fixes), it is injected into the sandbox so the agent can assess whether previous findings were addressed.

## How it helps

- Every PR gets a thorough review within minutes, regardless of team availability.
- Reviews cover security, correctness, intent & coherence, style, and docs currency — dimensions humans sometimes skip under time pressure.
- The structured output format makes it easy to see what was flagged and why.

## Commands

| Command | Where | Effect |
|---------|-------|--------|
| `/fs-review` | Issue or PR comment | Triggers a review |

Requires OWNER, MEMBER, or COLLABORATOR repository association.

The `/fs-review` command does not accept arguments. The review agent also runs
automatically when a PR is opened, synchronized (new commits pushed), or moved
out of draft by a repository owner, member, or collaborator.

## Control labels

These labels are applied by the review post-script based on the review outcome.

| Label | Meaning |
|-------|---------|
| `ready-for-review` | Signals the review agent to evaluate the PR. Applied by the [code agent](code.md) post-script. |
| `ready-for-merge` | The review agent approved the PR. No blocking findings. |
| `requires-manual-review` | The review agent found issues that require human judgment — it could not confidently approve or reject. |
| `rejected` | The review agent rejected the PR and the post-script closed it. |

When the review agent requests changes (without rejecting), no outcome label is
applied — the `pull_request_review` event triggers the [fix agent](fix.md) directly.

Stale outcome labels from prior review runs are removed before the new one is
applied.

The `issue-labels` skill may also apply contextual labels (e.g., `area/api`,
`priority/high`) but these are informational -- they do not control agent
behavior.

## Configuration and extension

### Skill: `issue-labels`

The review agent includes the `issue-labels` skill to discover your repo's
labels and apply them to PRs during review. This is the same skill used by the
[triage agent](triage.md) -- overloading it affects both agents.

To overload the built-in skill, create your own `issue-labels` skill in
`.agents/skills/issue-labels/SKILL.md` and symlink `.claude/skills` to
`.agents/skills` so it's discoverable by both fullsend and local agent tooling.
You can also overload it at the org level in your `.fullsend` config repo at
`customized/skills/issue-labels/SKILL.md`. At runtime, your version replaces
the upstream default -- no other configuration needed.

[Customizing with Skills](../guides/user/customizing-with-skills.md).
